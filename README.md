# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
Here in the repo, I am undertaking a project where I am implementing codes to simulate the process of the hangman game. 
It is an implementation of the game where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. Here I am using this implementation to test my coding journey so far. I have created codes that have implemented the creation of a random word and the guessing of a random letter by a user and written functions to see If the letter is in the random word. So far the code works and I am moving ahead with the other parts of the project.
